The nft.stellar.buzz NFT project exists as two projects. A `Client` and a `Server`.

## Client
This is the frontend for our app. The website where folks can interact with our service both minting and and transacting in our NFT.

## Server
This is the authorization server for our NFTs. This API is how users will request authorized transactions for minting and transacting the NFTs.
